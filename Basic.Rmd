## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r test, echo=TRUE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ROOTDIR <- "C:\\Users\\Diego\\Desktop\\NDPH\\Nested case-control study\\"
```

## 1. Prep your data
Define datasets that will be called into R for plotting. 
`ROOTDIR`  = path to where data with results to plot is located
